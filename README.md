//Overview
Feastr is a Tinder-like web app designed to help users discover new restaurants in Calgary. Users can swipe left (pass) or right (like) on restaurants, and when they match with a restaurant, they can view details, including cuisine type, location, and reviews. The app integrates with Google Maps, allowing users to get directions easily. Feastr simplifies decision-making by making restaurant discovery fun and engaging.

////Problem Space
Finding a place to eat can be overwhelming with so many choices available. Traditional restaurant discovery apps provide extensive lists but lack an engaging and quick way to browse options. Feastr solves this by offering a swipe-based interface, allowing users to quickly explore and choose restaurants without information overload.
